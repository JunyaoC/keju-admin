- Job Title  
- Location

- Pay Rate/Perks  
- Description  

**Action Buttons:**  
- **“Post Job”** (with confirmation).  
- **“Save as Draft”** (for reuse later).

### **Additional Considerations for Flexibility**
- **Save Templates:** Allow employers to save this job as a reusable template for similar roles in the future.  
- **Clone Job Option:** Copy details from an existing job posting with slight modifications.  
- **Multi-Day Scheduling:** If the job spans multiple days, add an option to input a schedule (e.g., 3 evenings, same hours).

By providing structured fields with optional flexibility, businesses can craft postings that suit their unique needs while attracting the right candidates.
